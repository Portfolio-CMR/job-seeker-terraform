## üåü Overview

This portfolio project showcases the ability to leverage Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles using Terraform to deploy a production-ready EC2 instance optimized for hosting LLM applications on AWS. The setup adheres to AWS best practices and implements robust security measures.

## üî• Features

- Automated EC2 instance provisioning
- Secure networking configuration with VPC and subnets
- Hardened security groups and NACLs
- IAM roles and policies for least-privilege access
- Encrypted EBS volumes for data protection
- Auto-scaling capabilities for handling variable loads
- CloudWatch integration for monitoring and logging
- Secrets management using AWS Secrets Manager

## üõ† Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- Terraform (v1.0.0+)
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Basic understanding of AWS services and Terraform

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-llm-hosting-aws.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd secure-llm-hosting-aws
   ```

3. Initialize Terraform:
   ```
   terraform init
   ```

4. Review and customize the `variables.tf` file to match your requirements.

5. Plan the infrastructure:
   ```
   terraform plan
   ```

6. Apply the configuration:
   ```
   terraform apply
   ```

7. Confirm the changes and wait for the infrastructure to be provisioned.

## üîí Security Measures

- VPC with public and private subnets
- Security groups limiting inbound/outbound traffic
- IAM roles with least-privilege permissions
- EBS volume encryption at rest
- HTTPS enforcement for all traffic
- Regular automated security patches
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) integration

## üîß Customization

The `variables.tf` file allows for easy customization of various aspects of the infrastructure, including:

- Instance type and size
- VPC and subnet configurations
- Security group rules
- IAM role permissions
- EBS volume size and type
